# Contributing

The  rollbar-java project was originally written by rollbar-java in 2001. It has since moved to rollbar-java and is maintained by just a few who volunteer their spare time.  

Over the years, rollbar-java has accumulated a rather large user base. This presents a challenge to the rollbar-java when it comes to managing communications. Welcome to the world of software development, right?

In order to keep the kinds of issues, which require changes to the source code, separate from all other questions and comments, our methods of communication are organized in the following manner:

- The rollbar-java  rollbar-java forum is intended for bug reports and serious feature requests only
- The rollbar-java user forum is intended for general questions and tech support
- The rollbar-java IRC channel is intended for general questions and tech support

More details can be found in our [rollbar-javaPosting Rules](https://rollbar-java.com/rollbar-java/rollbar-java/wiki/rollbar-java-Posting-Rules). Please read this before creating an issue in our rollbar-javaforum.

Knowledge of rollbar-java is a necessary first step to contribute to the project. To contribute, one must generate a pull request. For those just starting out, [rollbar-java](https://.rollbar-java.com/rollbar-java/rollbar-java/wiki/Understanding-rollbar-and-Pull-Requests) will step you through the process. 

Note that pasting code into our  rollbar-java forum, with the expectation we will do the work for you, is not acceptable.
