				NEW INSTALLS
================================================================================

1. Unless you are already using MySQL server, you need to ensure that
   the server is confired to start during boot and properly secured
   by running:

     sudo service mysqld start
     /usr/bin/mysql_secure_installation
     sudo chkconfig mysqld on

2. Using the password for the root account set during the previous step, you
   will need to create the ZoneMinder database:

     mysql -uroot -p
	mysql> create database zm;
	mysql> grant select,insert,update,delete,alter on zm.* to
               'zmuser'@localhost identified by 'zmpass';
	mysql> exit;
     mysql -uroot -p < /usr/share/zoneminder/db/zm_create.sql
     mysqladmin -uroot -p reload

3. IMPORTANT: Edit /etc/php.ini and put in the appropriate timezone for
   date.timezone!

4. The ZoneMinder web interface is disabled by default, you will need
   to edit this file to enable it:

     /etc/httpd/conf.d/zoneminder.conf

   HINT: Most users will want to simply delete the line that says
   "Deny from all".

5. Configure the web server to start automatically:

     sudo chkconfig httpd on
     sudo service httpd start

6. This package has automatically configured and installed an SELinux policy
   called local_zoneminder. A copy of this policy is in the documentation
   folder.

7. Finally, you may start the ZoneMinder service:

     sudo service zoneminder start

   Then point your web browser to http://<machine name or ip>/zm

				UPGRADES
================================================================================

1. Add the mysql ALTER permission to the zmuser account:

     mysql -u root -p
     grant alter on zm.* to
     'zmuser'@localhost identified by 'zmpass';

   Since this is an upgrade, the assumption is that the zmuser account already
   has select, insert, update, and delete permission.
   
2. You will need to upgrade the ZoneMinder database as described in the manual.
   Only if the previous step was succesful, may you run zmupdate like so:
   
    sudo zmupdate.pl --version=<from version>
   
   
   If unsure then run it this way:

   sudo zmupdate.pl --user=root --pass=<mysql_root_pwd> --version=<from version>
